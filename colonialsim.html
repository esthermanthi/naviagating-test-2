		<h1>colonialsm</h1>
		<p>Colonialism is a practice of domination, which involves the subjugation<br> of one people to another. One of the difficulties in<br> defining colonialism is that it is hard to distinguish it<br> from imperialism.  Like colonialism, imperialism also involves political and economic<br> control over a dependent territor<br></p>

							<h4>Leadership.</h4>
							<p>  Through colonialism,the structure of having men as rulers and leaders was inherited.This has<br> made the present commmunities have the belief that only men can be leaders and lead<br>.Men have also taken that as an advantage to rule over women .We have so <br>many women in our country who can have the ability to lead in a better way but simply because they do not get the support it still makes it impossible for them to lead and even if they lead,they dont stay in their<br> leadership positions for long or in peaceful way</p>

							<h4> culture.</h4>
							<p>Another structure that was inherited from colonialism that is negative is the inheritance of the western culture.This has made most Africans and more so in kenya ,make many people forget about their African culture.This does not only affect the economy in Africa parts but also make many young people growing up to never know about their culture.This can be solved by making the young generation realise about their culture and making them know about it at a young age and this will make them grow knowing their culture and the importance of upholding their culture.</p>

							<h4> Agriculture</h4>
							<p>The exponential population increase in recent decades has increased the practice of agricultural land conversion to meet the demand for food which in turn has increased the effects on the environment. The global population is still increasing and will eventually stabilize, as some critics doubt that food production, due to lower yields from global warming, can support the global population. Agriculture can have negative effects on biodiversity as well. Organic farming is a multifaceted sustainable agriculture set of practices that can have a lower impact on the environment at a small scale. However, in most cases organic farming results in lower yields in terms of production per unit area.[29] Therefore, widespread adoption of organic agriculture will require additional land to be cleared and water resources extracted to meet the same level of production.</p>

							<h4> Boundaries</h4>
							<p>Over a hundred new nations were born during the process of de-colonization. Most of these new nations, however, ... had not existed at all as nations before colonization, or they had not existed within the post-colonial borders.Most colonial and Soviet satellite borders were created either through conquest, negotiation between empires, or simply by administrative action with little or no regard for the social realities of those living in the areas.Nevertheless, many of the leaders and governments of postcolonial and post-Soviet states have fought to keep the territorial boundaries created by past imperialist governments. As a result, a number of boundary conflicts have arisen within post-colonial and post-Soviet territories</p>

							<h4> Ethnic Rivalry</h4>
							<p>Colonial and Soviet powers often created situations that encouraged ethnic rivalry. For example, when the Soviets took control of the Ferghana Valley in Central Asia, they created boundaries that separated members of the same ethnic group (i.e. the Tajiks) into different multiethnic regions. "This enabled the Soviet authorities to continuously be called upon by the people of the region to help them manage conflicts that were bound to emerge as a result of these artificial divisions." European and Soviet imperialists also sometimes favored one ethnic or religious group over other groups in the region. This practice of favoring one group, or of giving one group a higher status in colonial society, created and promoted inter-group rivalries</p>
